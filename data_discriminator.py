        The motivation of accounting for the confusion matrix like so,
        is to avoid matrix inversion, which makes off-diagonal elements
        very large (since these are typically just a few percent in size
        in the confusion matrix).

        ... and return [x0, x1]. This vector is the vector in which
        the difference between the measured data and the guessed original
        is the smallest.
        
        confusion_matrix should be given as a numpy array. If measurement
        error mitigation is performed on two states, and two qubits, then
        the confusion matrix must by definition be a (states^qubits) large
        matrix. 3 states, 2 qubits, would require a 3^2 = 9x9 matrix.
        Its axes would be Measured 2q state |00>, |01> ... |21>, |22> on the
        x-axis, and Prepared 2q state |00>, |01> ... |21>, |22> on the y-axis.

        allows the user to check the single-qubit probability, by supplying

        Example: if the user wants to see the probability of qubit 1 being
        in |1>, while the state probability of the other qubit(s) is
        irrelevant, then the user can provide here ['10','11','12']
        for instance. Whether qubit 2 was in |0>, |1> or |2> is irrelevant,
